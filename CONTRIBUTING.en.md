## Translation

Please pick any work without translation by `submit new issue`. English version and Chinese version are distinguished by file name, e.g. Chinese version file name abc.md, the corresponding English version should be abc.en.md. 

Manual translation instead of machine translation, there is no need to translate the technical jargon.
