## Problem Description

```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Solution

The easiest solution to come up with is Brute Force. We could write two for-loops to traverse every element, and find the target numbers that meet the requirement. However, the time complexity of this solution is O(N^2), while the space complexity is O(1). Apparently, we need to find a way to optimize this solution since the time complexity is too high. What we could do is to record the numbers we have traversed and the relevant index with a Map. Whenever we meet a new number during traversal, we go back to the Map and check whether the `diff` between this number and the target number appeared before. If it did, the problem has been solved and there's no need to continue.

## Key Points

- Find the difference instead of the sum
- Connect every number with its index through the help of Map
- Less time by more space. Reduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(1)

## Code

- Support Language: JS

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const diff = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(diff)) {
      return [map.get(diff), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
};
```
