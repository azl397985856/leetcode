## Problem Description

```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Solution

The easiest solution to come up with is Brute Force. We could write two for-loops to traverse every element, and find the target numbers that meet the requirement. However, the time complexity of this solution is O(N^2), while the space complexity is O(1). Apparently, we need to find a way to optimize this solution since the time complexity is too high. What we could do is to record the numbers we have traversed and the relevant index with a Map. Whenever we meet a new number during traversal, we go back to the Map and check whether the `diff` between this number and the target number appeared before. If it did, the problem has been solved and there's no need to continue.

## Key Points

- Find the difference instead of the sum
- Connect every number with its index through the help of Map
- Less time by more space. Reduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(1)

## Code

- Support Language: JS,C++,Java,Python

Javascript Code:

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const diff = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(diff)) {
      return [map.get(diff), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
};
```

C++ Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> hashtable;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            auto it = hashtable.find(target - nums[i]);
            if (it != hashtable.end()) {
                return {it->second, i};
            }
            hashtable[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

Java Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> hashtable = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (hashtable.containsKey(target - nums[i])) {
                return new int[]{hashtable.get(target - nums[i]), i};
            }
            hashtable.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
}
```

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashtable = dict()
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if target - num in hashtable:
                return [hashtable[target - num], i]
            hashtable[nums[i]] = i
        return []
```
