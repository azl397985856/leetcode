## Introduction

![leetcode.jpeg](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1ghltwf4xivj30dw0780sm.jpg)

LeetCode Solutions: A Journey of Problem Solving.

This repository is divided into five parts for now:

- The first part is the solutions to some classic problems on LeetCode, including the idea thinkings, key points and code implementations.

- The second part is a summary of data structures and algorithms.

- The third part is [Anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net) that organizes the LeetCode problems in a certain way to make it easier to remember.

- The fourth part is daily challenges which were held at group chat. We usually solve one problem altogether to get more feedback. Moreover, the problems can be drafted to add to the problem solving module.

- The fifth part is a future planning on content that will be introduced into the above parts.

> Only when having mastered the basic data structures and algorithms can you solve complex problems easily.

## About me

I, a programmer, am all passionate about technology.

Used to write `.net` and `Java`, I am a frontend engineer and focused on the engineering, optimization and standardization for frontend.

## Usage Instructions

- For the parts that were added recently, there will be a ðŸ†• behind.
- For the parts that were updated recently, there will be a ðŸ–Š behind.
- Here will be the place to update Anki Flashcards in the future as well.
- Here is a mind mapping graph showing the summary of categorizations of problems that are questioned frequently in interviews. We could analyze according to the information in the graph.

(Picture credited by [LeetCode-cn](https://www.zhihu.com/question/24964987/answer/586425979).)

The algorithms mainly include:

- Basic skills: Divide-and-Conquer; Binary; Greedy
- Sorting algorithms: Quicksort; Merge Sort; Counting Sort
- Searching algorithms: Backtracking; Recursion; Depth-First-Search (DFS); Breath-First-Search (BFS); Binary Search Tree; etc.
- Graph theory: Shortest Path Problem; Minimal Spanning Tree
- Dynamic Programming: Knapsack Problem; Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Problem

The data structures mainly include:

- Array and linked list: Singly/Doubly-Linked List
- Stack and queue
- Hash table
- Heap: Min-Max Heap
- Tree and Graph: Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA); Disjoint-Set
- String: Prefix Tree (Trie); Suffix Tree

### Anki Flashcards

Anki falshcards would be mainly two parts: the mappings from key points to problems; the mappings from problems to idea thinks, key points and code implementations.

All flashcards are put in [anki-card](./assets/anki/leetcode.apkg).

> Please check [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for more about the usage of Anki.

Latest updated flashcards (only lists the front page):

- What is the key point of the binary search algorithm? Related problems?
- How to simplify the operations using the features of stacks? Related problems?
- The thinkings and related problems of double-pointers problems?
- The thinkings and related problems of sliding window problems?
- The thinkings and related problems of backtracking?
- The thinkings and related problems of number theory?
- The thinkings and related problems of bit operations?

> WIP: the translation of the flashcards are on the way.
